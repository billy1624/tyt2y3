### Software Engineer in Computer Graphics & Vision

I started my GitHub journey 10 years ago. Being a strong believer in open source, I strive to build a profitable technology company on top of sustainable open source projects. I graduated from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in Computer Engineering with First Class Honors in 2014. I was a Software Engineer at Harmonic in the Engineering team behind ElectraX during 2014 to 2016. In 2018, I started my technology company and has been thriving (aka. struggling) ever since.

If you like what I do, consider starring (I have stars for breakfast), commenting, sharing and contributing. Collaboration on open source is the best thing humanity ever had.
