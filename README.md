### Software Engineer in Computer Graphics & Vision

I started my GitHub journey 10 years ago. Being a strong believer in open source, I strive to build a profitable technology company on top of sustainable open source projects.

If you like what I do, consider starring (I have stars for breakfast), commenting, sharing and contributing. Collaboration on open source is the best thing humanity ever had.
